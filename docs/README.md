# Documentation

## Updating & generating files
Documentation is built with Sphinx - Python documentation generator. Make sure to install Sphinx and its dependencies [sphinx-doc.org](https://www.sphinx-doc.org/).

**Note:** sphinx-rtd-theme is not bundled by default and you may have to install it either with `pip` or your OS package manager.
